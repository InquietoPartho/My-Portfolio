            <h3>Problem Solver | Coder | Open Source Contributor</h3>
            <p> I'm a passionate programmer and open source enthusiast driven by the thrill of solving problems and building
                things that make a difference. My journey in the world of code began with a fascination for unraveling its complexities,<br> 
                and it has since evolved into a love for crafting elegant solutions and contributing to the vibrant open source community.</p>

            <h2>My Dreams</h2>
            <p>
                My wildest dreams bloom at the intersection of code and impact. Picture me, honed by algorithmic battles on CodeForces and LeetCode,<br>
                tackling real-world challenges. Collaborative spirit, nurtured by open source, fuels my desire to build projects that touch millions.<br>
                I'm more than code; I'm an eager learner, a fast adapter, and a team player driven by the thrill of leaving a lasting mark. Open that door, and let's chase dreams together.</p>

                <h3><span class = "name-highlight">From Prodigy to Pause, and Back to the Code Symphony: My Competitive Programming Journey</span></h3>
                <p> My coding journey began in 2017, fueled by the fire of competition. Diving into the "National High School Programming Contest,"
                    I took my first steps, planting the seeds of what would blossom into a National Championship just a year later at the "Nation Child and Teenager Programming Contest."
                    College, however, presented new challenges, and coding took a backseat. But the call of the keyboard was too strong to ignore. In 2023, after a four-year hiatus,
                    I'm back on the codeforces and leetcode battlefields, the competitive spirit rekindled and ready to conquer new heights.</p>

                <h2>2023: A Year of Exponential Coding Growth</h2>
                <h3><span class="name-highlight">Conquering Codes and Conquering Challenges</span></h3>
                    <p>
                    This year has been a whirlwind of learning and growth in the realm of programming. I've expanded my coding toolkit by mastering C and C++, delved into the intricacies of data structures and algorithms, and embraced object-oriented programming principles in C++ to create more robust and adaptable code. To further hone my problem-solving skills, I've successfully tackled over 150 challenges on codeforces and LeetCode, proving my ability to apply knowledge effectively in diverse scenarios. Each challenge has fueled my passion for coding, and I'm eager to continue this journey of continuous learning and exploration.
